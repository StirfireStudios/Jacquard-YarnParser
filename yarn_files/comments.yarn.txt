/* I AM A MULTILINE Comment
[[FearTheLackOfOption]]
I can have * in here as well
-> Also shortcutsss.
  Woo, shortcutsss.

<< Not really a command >>
<< $var = "not really setting a var">>
*/

<< simple command >> // I am a single line comment

<<test command with arguments>> // I am also a single line comment

<< if $variable is false >> // I am a single line comment
  statement1 // Now this is starting
<<else>> // to get a little
  statement2 // excessive
<<endif>> // whoa

<< func(1 + 2 * 3 / 4 % 5) >> // func-y comment

<< func(1+2*3/4%5) >> // even func-y'er comment

<< func(1, 2, 3) >> // func'y comment with triple the arguments

[[ Option Text A | OptionLinkA ]] // this option is A
[[ Option Text B | OptionLinkB ]] // this option is B
[[ Option Text C | OptionLinkC ]] // this option is C

-> Option 1 // this is option 1
   I am text in option 1 // this is text in option 1
// I am a comment and i shouldn't do things to options...
   -> Nested 1a // this is a nested option
     I don't get a comment
   -> Nested 2a
     I also didn't have a comment // but there is one here
// Comment on a line!
/* I am also commenty goodness
-> Option 3
*/-> Option 2 
   I should still be part of the group option 1 is part of
