Here we have an if test on $ifBranch to be true and if that's true we display a thing (also the if has a capital I and the else is ElSe)
<< If $ifBranch>>
	$ifBranch was true, also this should display without leading tabs.
<<ElSe>>
	$ifBranch was FALSE D: D:
also this should be on two lines without leading tabs.
